# TODO

## Phase 1: Setup & Database ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Initialize Next.js project
- [x] Set up Supabase project
- [x] Create database schema
- [x] Add environment variables
- [x] Test DB connection

## Phase 2: Extraction Pipeline ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Create /api/extract endpoint
- [x] Implement Jina AI fetch
- [x] Implement Claude extraction
- [x] Add error handling
- [x] Test with 5 different URLs

## Phase 2B: Database Integration & Many-to-Many Schema ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Migrate schema to many-to-many (items ↔ collections)
- [x] Create collection_items junction table with metadata
- [x] Update TypeScript database types
- [x] Create /api/items POST endpoint (save extracted data)
- [x] Create /api/collections CRUD endpoints
- [x] Create /api/collections/[id]/items GET/POST endpoints
- [x] Test items in multiple collections
- [x] Verify collection-specific notes and position
- [x] Update documentation

## Phase 2C: Schema Refinements & Caching ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Add UNIQUE constraint on source_url (prevent duplicate entries)
- [x] Add last_viewed_at timestamp to items (for staleness tracking)
- [x] Move extraction prompt to dedicated file (prompts/extraction.txt)
- [x] Add needs_review flag for low confidence extractions (< 0.7)
- [ ] Implement URL deduplication check (24hr cache window)
- [ ] Add RLS policies preparation notes for future auth

## Phase 3: /add Page - iOS Shortcuts Integration ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Create /add page with mobile-first responsive design
- [x] Handle URL parameter from iOS Shortcut (?url=...)
- [x] **Browser-based flow**: Show loading → POST /api/items → Show success
- [x] Loading state with animation (3-10s extraction duration)
- [x] Success view with extracted item preview
- [x] Handle low confidence items (needs_review flag) with visual warning
- [x] Error handling with retry functionality
- [x] Duplicate URL detection (saves API cost)
- [x] Test full flow: iOS Share Sheet → Browser → Extraction → Success

**Note:** Original plan included "Shadow Save" (instant save with background extraction and polling). After UX analysis, chose simpler synchronous browser-based flow with rich loading feedback for the 3-10 second extraction duration.

## Phase 3B: /add Page Refactor - "Context-First Capture" ✅ COMPLETE
**Goal**: Transform /add from blocking "wait for AI" to active "define intent while AI works" flow.

**Key Innovation**: User types context (notes, collections) while extraction happens in background. Race condition handling via `saveIntent` pattern ensures save happens as early as possible.

### Phase 3B.1: Foundation (Types & Hooks) ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Create `/types/capture.ts` - State machine type definitions
  - CaptureState, ExtractionState, CaptureContext, SaveIntent types
- [x] Create `/app/add/hooks/useCaptureState.ts` - State management logic
  - State machine transitions
  - Race condition handling (saveIntent pattern)
- [x] Create `/app/add/hooks/useMockProgress.ts` - Progress bar timing
  - 0→80% over 5s, exponential slowdown, freeze at 80%, jump to 100% on complete

### Phase 3B.2: Core UI Components ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Create `/app/add/components/SourceUrlBadge.tsx` - URL display pill
- [x] Create `/app/add/components/MockProgressBar.tsx` - Progress indicator
  - Status text: "Librarian is cataloging details..."
  - Visual states: active (blue), stalled (amber), complete (green), error (red)
- [x] Create `/app/add/components/ContextForm.tsx` - Notes textarea (auto-focused)
  - Label: "Add Your Context"
  - Placeholder: "e.g., Research for the kitchen remodel, a birthday gift idea for Shannon..."
- [x] Create `/app/add/components/CollectionSelector.tsx` - Multi-select chips
  - Horizontal scrollable chip list
  - Label: "File Under" or "Organize Into"
  - Default "Inbox" pre-selected

### Phase 3B.3: Extraction Components ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Create `/app/add/components/ExtractedItemCard.tsx`
  - Skeleton state with pulse animation
  - Smooth transition to real data
  - Confidence badge (amber if < 0.7)
- [x] Create `/app/add/components/RecentlyTroved.tsx`
  - Horizontal scroll container
  - Last 5 items added
- [x] Create `/app/add/components/CaptureActions.tsx`
  - Save button with states: "Save", "Saving...", "Finalizing..."
  - Cancel button

### Phase 3B.4: API Updates ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] No modification to `/app/api/items/route.ts` needed - already supports collections parameter
  - Existing endpoint handles extraction + collection assignment in one call
  - Race condition handling done client-side in useCaptureState hook
- [x] Create `/app/api/items/recent/route.ts` - Recent items endpoint
  - GET endpoint returning last 5 items (ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5)
- [x] Create Inbox collection auto-creation helper
  - `ensureInboxCollection()` function in `lib/inbox.ts`
  - Check if "Inbox" exists, create if not

### Phase 3B.5: Main Page Integration ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Refactor `/app/add/page.tsx` - Replace blocking flow with Context-First
  - Wire all new components
  - Implement state machine
  - Handle race conditions with saveIntent
  - Parallel fetch on mount: collections + recent items
  - Preserve iOS shortcut entry (`?url=` parameter)
  - Auto-focus textarea on load

### Phase 3B.6: Polish & Error Handling ✅ COMPLETE (Core Items)
- [x] Validation: Require notes OR collections (validated in useCaptureState.ts:206)
- [x] Error handling: Extraction failures, network errors (handled in useCaptureState.ts)
- [x] Loading states for collections fetch (collectionsLoading state in page.tsx)
- [x] Keyboard shortcuts (Cmd/Ctrl+Enter = save, Escape = reset) - tested and working
- [ ] Duplicate URL: Show existing item, allow adding new context (deferred - needs backend)
- [ ] Success animation after save (deferred - would add complexity)
- [ ] Extraction timeout handling (deferred - extraction usually completes in <30s)

**Testing Checklist (Playwright + Manual):**
- [x] **[Playwright]** Dev server running, navigate to /add page
- [x] **[Playwright]** URL parameter parsing (?url=...) works
- [x] **[Playwright]** Textarea auto-focuses on load
- [x] **[Playwright]** Progress bar animates smoothly (0→82%→100% with stalled state)
- [x] **[Playwright]** Collections load and multi-select works
- [x] **[Playwright]** Notes persist during extraction
- [x] **[Playwright]** Skeleton → real data transition smooth
- [x] **[Playwright]** Save after extraction: Immediate save (tested with notes + collection)
- [x] **[Playwright]** Recently Troved section loads
- [x] **[Playwright]** Error states display properly (no URL parameter)
- [x] **[Playwright]** Success view shows correct collection count
- [x] **[Playwright]** "Add Another Item" resets form correctly
- [x] **[Playwright]** Keyboard shortcut: Cmd/Ctrl+Enter saves when valid
- [x] **[Playwright]** Keyboard shortcut: Escape resets form
- [x] **[Manual]** iOS shortcut deep link works (test on actual iPhone) - validated by user
- [ ] **[Manual]** Save before extraction: Shows "Finalizing...", completes when done (needs slower endpoint to test)
- [ ] **[Manual]** Confidence badge shows for score < 0.7 (need low-confidence item to test)

**Race Condition Scenarios:**
1. User saves before extraction completes → saveIntent='pending' → "Finalizing..." → auto-save on complete
2. Extraction completes before user saves → saveIntent='ready' → "Item extracted - ready to save"
3. Simultaneous completion → Handle with optimistic state management

**Note**: Detailed plan at `/Users/cminnich/.claude/plans/fuzzy-hugging-feigenbaum.md`

- [x] **[Playwright]** Test navigation (mobile nav, Collections/Add/Settings links working)
- [x] **[Playwright]** Accessibility audit (ARIA labels, touch targets, keyboard nav, focus management, semantic HTML - all passed)

**Deferred to Later Phases:**
- [ ] Create new collection modal (deferred - use Supabase dashboard for now)
- [ ] Add/remove items from current collection (deferred - Phase 5)
- [ ] Filter by category/tags (deferred - Phase 5)

4. Implement collection sharing UI (Phase 9)
5. Add user settings page (manage profile, view shared collections)

## Bugs / Issues
- Some sites (REI, B&H Photo) fail extraction - likely due to JS-heavy pages or complex structures
- Amazon extraction works but often misses price data
- Jina AI reader may return 404 errors for some valid URLs

## Ideas for Later
- Photo upload
- Manual editing of items
- Bulk import from Amazon
- Price tracking
- Duplicate detection
- Collections sharing
