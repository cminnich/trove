# Trove Development Rules

## Global Context
See ~/Development/claude-code-system/GLOBAL_RULES.md for universal principles.

## Project Context
Building an MVP for Trove - a personal knowledge graph/collection manager optimized for AI consumption.

## Current Phase: POC
- iPhone shortcut → save links to DB
- AI extraction of product data (Jina + Claude)
- Simple visualization by category/tag
- Export optimized for LLM context (copy/paste)

## Tech Stack (see STACK.md for details)
- Next.js 15 (App Router)
- TypeScript
- Supabase (Postgres + Auth)
- Tailwind CSS
- Anthropic Claude API
- Jina AI Reader (free tier)

## Trove-Specific Patterns

### AI Extraction Pipeline
```typescript
// Always store both raw markdown AND extracted JSON
// Include confidence scores with all extractions
// Handle failures gracefully (save partial data)

const extraction = {
  rawMarkdown: jinaOutput,
  extracted: claudeOutput,
  confidence: 0.85,
  model: 'claude-sonnet-4-20250514',
  extractedAt: new Date()
};
```

### Database Schema Philosophy
- **UUID primary keys** everywhere (future-proof for multi-user)
- **Flexible attributes** via JSONB for item-specific data
- **Store extraction metadata** (which model, when, confidence)
- **Timestamps** on everything for debugging/analytics

### Mobile-First Design
```typescript
// This is iPhone-primary - desktop is secondary
// Test all UI on mobile viewport first
// Deep links must work reliably from iOS share sheet
```

## File Organization
```
app/
  api/
    extract/         # Jina + Claude extraction
  add/               # Deep link page for iOS shortcut
  collections/       # Collection views

lib/
  supabase.ts        # Supabase client
  extract.ts         # Extraction logic
  types.ts           # Shared types

components/
  ui/                # Reusable UI components

prompts/
  extraction.txt     # Claude extraction prompt
```

## When Working on This Project

1. Read PROJECT.md for current status and decisions
2. Check TODO.md for next phase
3. Test extraction with REAL URLs (don't mock)
4. Always run TypeScript check before committing
5. Mobile viewport first - this is for iPhone

## Trove-Specific Constraints

### What NOT to Do
- Don't add features not in TODO.md (scope creep kills POCs)
- Don't optimize prematurely (make it work first)
- Don't add tests yet (POC phase - validate first)
- Don't worry about auth yet (single-user for now)
- Don't add animations/polish yet (functional first)

### What to ALWAYS Do
- Store raw markdown from Jina (debugging/reprocessing)
- Include confidence scores (know when extraction is weak)
- Handle extraction failures gracefully (partial data > nothing)
- Test on actual iPhone (not just simulator)
- Update PROJECT.md learnings as we discover gotchas

## Success Criteria for POC
- [ ] Can share link from Safari → saves to DB
- [ ] AI extraction runs and saves structured data
- [ ] Can view saved items grouped by category
- [ ] Can export collection as formatted text for LLM
- [ ] Works on iPhone
